# JDBC
created a Database using JDBC application

# Java Database Connectivity

There are following six steps involved in building a JDBC application
---
* Import the packages: Requires that you include the packages containing the JDBC classes needed for database programming. Most often, using import java.sql.* will suffice.

* Register the JDBC driver: Requires that you initialize a driver so you can open a communication channel with the database.

* Open a connection: Requires using the DriverManager.getConnection() method to create a Connection object, which represents a physical connection with the database.

* Execute a query: Requires using an object of type Statement for building and submitting an SQL statement to the database.

* Extract data from result set: Requires that you use the appropriate ResultSet.getXXX() method to retrieve the data from the result set.

* Clean up the environment: Requires explicitly closing all database resources versus relying on the JVM's garbage collection.
